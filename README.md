E-Commerce Funnel & Category Leakage Analysis (Power BI)
Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior across the e-commerce purchase journey to identify conversion bottlenecks from Browse → Add to Cart → Purchase. Category-level leakage was quantified to determine which product segments contribute most to checkout abandonment and to prioritize improvement actions.

Business Objective

Improve purchase completion rates by diagnosing where and why users drop off in the funnel and by recommending targeted interventions for high-intent categories. The goal is to enhance revenue efficiency without increasing acquisition or marketing spend.

Scope of Analysis
Component	Description
Funnel Stages	Browse, Add to Cart, Purchase
Metrics	Conversion Rate, Leakage Volume, Abandonment
Segmentation	Category, Country
Output	Insights, Prioritization, Actionable Recommendations
Key Insights

Major leakage occurs between Add to Cart and Purchase stages.

Apparel, New, and Clearance categories exhibit high-intent behavior but low conversion, indicating checkout-stage friction.

Campus Collection and Drinkware categories demonstrate stronger conversion and serve as performance benchmarks.

Improving conversion in high-intent categories yields higher ROI than increasing top-of-funnel traffic.

Data Limitations

Analysis is based on event-level behavior and does not include pricing, inventory, session duration, couponing, or churn metrics. Additional telemetry would enable stronger causal attribution and optimization modeling.
