# E-Commerce Funnel & Category Leakage Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the e-commerce purchase journey to identify conversion bottlenecks across the Browse → Add to Cart → Purchase funnel. Category-level leakage was quantified to determine which product segments contribute most to checkout abandonment and to prioritize improvement actions.

## Business Objective
Improve purchase completion rates by diagnosing where and why users drop off and by recommending targeted interventions for high-intent categories. The goal is to increase revenue efficiency without increasing acquisition or marketing spend.

## Scope of Analysis
- Funnel stages: Browse, Add to Cart, Purchase
- Metrics: Conversion rate, Leakage volume, Abandonment
- Segmentation: Category, Country
- Output: Insights, prioritization, recommendations

## Key Insights
- Largest drop-off occurs between Add to Cart and Purchase stages.
- Apparel, New, and Clearance categories show high-intent behavior but low purchase completion.
- Campus Collection and Drinkware categories convert well and act as performance benchmarks.
- Improving conversion in high-intent categories yields stronger ROI than increasing top-of-funnel traffic.

## Methodology
1. Funnel performance measurement
2. Category leakage quantification
3. Benchmark identification
4. Root-cause hypothesis evaluation
5. Prioritization and recommendations

## Tools and Techniques
- Power BI (Dashboarding, Data Modeling, Interactive Filtering)
- DAX (Custom Measures)
- Funnel and Segmentation Analysis
- Business and Product Analytics

## Deliverables
- Multi-page Power BI dashboard:
  - Funnel performance view
  - Category leakage view
  - Insights and recommendations view
- Case study summary
- Dataset documentation

## Future Enhancements
- Device and channel segmentation
- Pricing and promotion metadata
- Checkout & payment error telemetry
- Experimentation (A/B testing)
- LTV and retention modeling

## Data Limitations
Analysis is based on event-level behavior and does not include pricing, inventory, promotion, session duration, or checkout error telemetry. Additional data would enable stronger causal inference and optimization modeling.
